AI Agent Design for Intelligence Tests: RPM-Project

Designed a knowledge-base AI agent to pass **RPM** (Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices) tests, the AI agent took around 30 seconds for solving all 192 problems including both 2x2 problems and 3x3 problems, the AI agent ultimately returned 112 out of 192 problems a correct answer in around **60% accuracy**. Details see the Final-Project-Report. 

The Raven's Progressive Matrices (**RPM**) test is a commonly used human intelligence test based on visual analogy problems (Raven, Raven, & Court 1998). RPM is regarded as a non-verbal estimate of fluid intelligence, it has not only been typically used to measure general human intelligence and abstract reasoning, but also has been often used as the psychometric measure of choice in educational
and clinical settings.
