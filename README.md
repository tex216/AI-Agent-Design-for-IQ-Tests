Designing a knowledge-base AI agent to pass **RPM** (Raven’s Progressive Matrices) tests, details see the Final-Project-Report.

RPM is regarded as a non-verbal estimate of fluid intelligence, it has not only been typically used to measure general human intelligence and abstract reasoning, but also has been often used as the psychometric measure of choice in educational
